Kobi’s Student Atlas — Complete Mobile App Specification
1. Executive Summary

Kobi’s Student Atlas is a mobile-first academic companion for students at Babcock University. The app is designed to:

Track courses, organized by semesters

Handle past and current semesters

Automatically calculate grades using the Babcock University grading system

Compute semester GPA and CGPA (current and predicted)

Allow full CRUD operations for semesters and courses

Offer multiple themes and UI modes

Export and backup academic data

Provide offline support with Firebase as the backend

Project Background:

“Student Atlas was an individual project by Kobi Oguadinma, a second-year Software Engineering student at Babcock University. He frequently calculated his predicted grades manually and wanted a mobile app to automate this process.”

2. Academic System (Babcock University)
Grading Table & GPA Mapping (5-point scale)
Grade	Score Range	GPA Points	Notes
A	≥80	5.0	Target grade
B	60–79	4.0	Target grade
C	50–59	3.0	Target grade
D	40–49	2.0	Fail
E	30–39	1.0	Fail
F	<30	0.0	Fail

D/E/F grades are included in GPA calculations but cannot be selected as target grades

Only one current semester is allowed at a time

Other academic systems will be supported in future updates

3. Core Features

Course CRUD is within semesters

Dynamic exam target table for current semester courses

3.3 GPA & CGPA

Semester GPA: Weighted by unit hours

Semester GPA
=
∑
(
unit hours
×
grade points
)
∑
unit hours
Semester GPA=
∑unit hours
∑(unit hours×grade points)
	​


CGPA: Average of all past semester GPAs

Predicted CGPA: Includes predicted GPA for current semester

5.2 Backend (Firebase)
Authentication

Firebase Auth (email/password)

Firestore Database
users/
  {userId}/
    semesters/
      {semesterId}/
        name: string
        type: 'past'|'current'
        timestamp: number
        gpa: number
        predictedGPA?: number
        courses/
          {courseId}/
            name: string
            code: string
            unitHours: number
            caScores: { midterm: number, assignment: number, quiz: number, attendance: number }
            targetGrade: 'A'|'B'|'C'
            finalScore?: number
            grade?: 'A'|'B'|'C'|'D'|'E'|'F'
            difficulty: 1|2|3|4|5

Firestore Security Rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId}/semesters/{semesterId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      match /courses/{courseId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }
  }
}

Firebase Integration (Android / Replit)
// Root build.gradle
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.4")
    }
}

// App module build.gradle
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'

dependencies {
    implementation platform("com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:34.6.0")
    implementation "com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics"
    implementation "com.google.firebase:firebase-auth"
    implementation "com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore"
}


google-services.json should be placed in android/app/

Initialize Firebase in firebaseConfig.ts:

import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const db = getFirestore(app);

6. Calculations
6.1 Grade Calculation

Convert final score to Babcock grade

Map grade to 5-point GPA

6.2 Semester GPA
Semester GPA
=
∑
(
unit hours
×
grade points
)
∑
unit hours
Semester GPA=
∑unit hours
∑(unit hours×grade points)
	​

6.3 CGPA
CGPA
=
∑
(
past semester GPA
×
semester units
)
∑
(
past semester units
)
CGPA=
∑(past semester units)
∑(past semester GPA×semester units)
	​


Predicted CGPA includes current semester predicted GPA
